# Generative AI vs Agentic AI — Video 2

## 1. Introduction

This playlist teaches Agentic AI using LangGraph. Before learning Agentic AI, it’s important to understand how it differs from Generative AI.

## 2. What is Generative AI?

Generative AI (GenAI) refers to AI models that can create new content such as:

* Text (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude)
* Images (DALL·E, Midjourney)
* Code (Code Llama)
* Speech (ElevenLabs)
* Videos (Sora, Runway ML)

### Simple Definition

Generative AI models learn from existing data and create new data that looks like it was created by humans.

### How GenAI Works

* It does not focus on input-output relationships like traditional AI.
* It learns the pattern and distribution of data.
* It generates new samples from that learned distribution.

### Example

Give GenAI thousands of cat images → it learns what a cat looks like → generates a new cat image.

## 3. Traditional AI vs Generative AI

| Feature     | Traditional AI                         | Generative AI             |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Purpose     | Predict or classify                    | Create new content        |
| Learning    | Finds relations between input & output | Learns data distribution  |
| Examples    | Spam detection, cancer detection       | ChatGPT, Midjourney       |
| Output Type | Label or number                        | Text, Image, Audio, Video |

## 4. Applications of Generative AI

* Creative Writing: blogs, email drafting
* Software Development: code generation, debugging
* Customer Support: chatbots
* Education: learning assistance
* Design: thumbnails, infographics, AI-generated ads

## 5. Scenario — HR Hiring Workflow

**Goal:** Hire a Backend Engineer

### Hiring Steps

1. Write Job Description (JD)
2. Post job on platforms like LinkedIn
3. Shortlist candidates
4. Schedule interviews
5. Conduct interviews
6. Send offer letter
7. Onboard the candidate

## 6. Four Levels of AI Solutions

### 1️⃣ Simple Generative AI Chatbot

**Capabilities:** Helps draft JD, emails, interview questions
**Problems:**

* Reactive (waits for input)
* No memory
* Generic advice
* Cannot take actions

### 2️⃣ RAG-based Chatbot (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

**Improvement:** Connect to company documents like:

* Old JDs, hiring strategies, onboarding policies
  **Benefits:**
* Company-specific answers
  **Limitation:** Still reactive, cannot act independently

### 3️⃣ Tool-Augmented Chatbot

**Improvements:** Connect with tools such as:

* LinkedIn API, resume parser, email sender, calendar tools
  **Benefits:**
* Can take real actions (post jobs, send emails, schedule interviews)
  **Limitation:** Still not proactive

### 4️⃣ Agentic AI (Final Stage)

**Capabilities:**

* Understands the goal
* Plans steps automatically
* Executes autonomously
* Has memory & context
* Adapts to changes
* Makes decisions

**Example Behavior:**

* Notices low applications → updates JD + boosts LinkedIn post
* Tracks onboarding and notifies only when approval is needed

## 7. Key Differences — Generative AI vs Agentic AI

| Feature            | Generative AI  | Agentic AI                     |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Goal               | Create content | Achieve a goal end-to-end      |
| Nature             | Reactive       | Proactive & autonomous         |
| Needs user prompt? | Yes            | Only once                      |
| Uses tools?        | Optional       | Mandatory                      |
| Memory             | Not always     | Yes                            |
| Planning           | No             | Yes                            |
| Adaptability       | No             | Yes                            |
| Components         | Only LLM       | LLM + Memory + Tools + Planner |

## 8. One-Line Understanding

**Generative AI = capability** → creates content
**Agentic AI = behavior** → achieves goals autonomously using GenAI + tools + memory + planning

## 9. Conclusion

Generative AI started the revolution, but Agentic AI is the next big leap where AI becomes:

* Autonomous
* Context-aware
* Action-driven
* Goal-oriented

Agentic AI doesn't just answer — it acts, plans, and completes tasks like a real digital employee.


# Agentic AI – Video 3

## What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI is a type of AI that:

* Takes a goal from a user
* Plans how to achieve it
* Executes tasks automatically
* Adapts when situations change
* Asks for help only when needed

➡️ It does things proactively, unlike normal chatbots which are only reactive.

---

### Example Difference

| Generative AI (ChatGPT)         | Agentic AI                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Answers only what you ask       | Takes your goal and completes the entire workflow |
| Reactive                        | Proactive                                         |
| No planning                     | Makes plans and executes                          |
| Needs instructions step-by-step | Works independently                               |

---

## Example

**Goal:** Hire a Backend Engineer

Agentic AI will:

* Understand the goal
* Create a job description (JD)
* Post on job portals
* Monitor applicants
* Modify strategy if no applications
* Parse resumes, shortlist candidates
* Schedule interviews using calendar
* Send offer letters
* Onboard selected candidate

➡️ You gave one goal → AI handled everything end-to-end.

---

## Key Characteristics of Agentic AI (6 Traits)

### 1. Autonomy

* Works independently without step-by-step human commands
* Takes actions on its own
* Shows autonomy in:

  * Execution
  * Decision-making
  * Tool selection

**Control Mechanisms:**

* Permission limits
* Human approval checkpoints
* Guardrails (policies)

### 2. Goal-Oriented

* Always works toward a defined goal
* Stores goals in memory
* Handles:

  * Plain goals → "Hire a backend engineer"
  * Goals with constraints → "Hire remotely, 2–4 years experience"
* Goals can be updated midway

### 3. Planning

Agentic AI works in two phases:

```
PLAN → EXECUTE → REPLAN (if something fails) → EXECUTE
```

Planning steps:

* Generate multiple plans
* Evaluate plans (cost, risk, tools, constraints)
* Select the best plan

### 4. Reasoning

Used in planning and execution to:

* Understand goal
* Break tasks into steps
* Decide tools to use
* Handle errors
* Decide when to involve human

**Reasoning = thinking logic of the agent**

### 5. Adaptability

Changes strategy if:

* Something fails (e.g., API is down)
* External feedback changes (low applicants)
* Goal changes midway

➡️ Agent modifies actions without restarting.

### 6. Context Awareness

Agent remembers:

* The main goal
* Task progress
* Past chats
* Tool responses
* User preferences
* Guardrails

**Memory Types:**

* Short-term memory → current session data
* Long-term memory → policies, user preferences, history

➡️ Without context, an agent cannot operate across multiple days or steps.

* What **LangGraph** is (technical overview)
* **LangChain vs LangGraph**
* When to use **LangChain** and when to use **LangGraph**

---

## 4. Prerequisites

You should already know:

* What **LangChain** is
* Basic LangChain components
* How simple LangChain code works

👉 If not, first watch:

* LangChain Introduction
* LangChain Components

---

## 5. Quick Recap: What is LangChain?

### Definition

> LangChain is an open-source library that simplifies building LLM-based applications.

### Why LangChain Exists

LLM-based applications require many parts:

* Prompts
* Models
* Retrieval
* Memory
* Tools

LangChain **simplifies and connects** all these parts.

---

## 6. Core LangChain Building Blocks

### 1. Models

* Unified interface for:

  * OpenAI
  * Anthropic (Claude)
  * HuggingFace
  * Ollama
* Easy to switch models **without rewriting code**

### 2. Prompts

* Helps design and manage prompts
* Supports prompt templates and reuse

### 3. Retrievers

* Fetch relevant data from:

  * Vector databases
  * Knowledge bases
* Used for **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** applications

### 4. Chains (Most Important)

* Connect components in a **linear sequence**
* Output of one step becomes input of the next step
* Best for:

  * Chatbots
  * Summarizers
  * Simple multi-step workflows

---

## 7. What Can You Build with LangChain?

* Chatbots
* Text summarizers
* Multi-step report generators
* RAG-based systems
* Basic agent-like workflows using tools

⚠️ **Limitation**:

* Works best for **linear workflows**
* Struggles with **complex, non-linear logic**

---

## 8. Workflow vs Agent (Very Important Concept)

### Workflow

* Steps are predefined by the developer
* Executes in the same order every time
* Static

### Agent

* LLM decides:

  * Steps
  * Order
  * Tool usage
* Dynamic and autonomous

👉 The automated hiring example shown is a **workflow**, not a full agent.

---

## 9. Automated Hiring Workflow (Overview)

Steps include:

* Receive hiring request
* Create job description (JD)
* Human approval
* Post job
* Wait & monitor applications
* Modify JD if needed (loop)
* Shortlist candidates
* Schedule interviews
* Conduct interviews
* Send offers
* Handle acceptance / rejection
* Onboarding

This workflow:

* Has loops
* Has conditions
* Has wait times
* Runs for **days or weeks**

---

## 10. Challenge 1: Control Flow Complexity

### Problem with LangChain

* LangChain chains are **linear**
* This workflow is **non-linear**:

  * Conditional branches
  * Loops
  * Jumps

### Result

* Requires a lot of custom **Python glue code**
* Glue code is:

  * Hard to maintain
  * Hard to debug
  * Error-prone

---

## 11. How LangGraph Solves Control Flow

### Key Idea

* Represent the workflow as a **graph**

  * Nodes = tasks
  * Edges = control flow

### Benefits

* Native support for:

  * Conditions
  * Loops
  * Jumps
* No glue code
* Cleaner and more maintainable logic

---

## 12. Challenge 2: State Handling

### What is State?

All important data during workflow execution, such as:

* Job description
* Approval status
* Application count
* Interview results
* Offer status

State **changes over time**.

### LangChain Problem

* LangChain is **stateless**
* Memory only stores conversation text
* State must be manually managed using dictionaries

---

## 13. LangGraph State Management

* LangGraph is **stateful**
* You define a **state object**
* Every node:

  * Can read state
  * Can update state
* State flows automatically across nodes

👉 LangChain = Stateless
👉 LangGraph = Stateful

---

## 14. Challenge 3: Event-Driven Execution

### Two Types of Execution

* **Sequential**: Runs start → end without stopping
* **Event-driven**:

  * Pauses
  * Waits for an external event
  * Resumes later

### Hiring Workflow Needs Event-Driven Execution

* Wait 7 days after job posting
* Wait 48 hours after JD modification
* Wait for candidate response
* Wait for human approvals

### LangChain Limitation

* No pause / resume support
* Workflow must be manually broken

### LangGraph Advantage

* Built-in pause & resume
* Uses checkpoints
* Can resume exactly where it stopped

---

## 15. Challenge 4: Fault Tolerance

### Problem

Long-running workflows can fail due to:

* API failure
* Server crash
* Network issues

### LangChain

* If it fails → start from the beginning

### LangGraph

* Supports:

  * Retry logic (small failures)
  * Recovery from last checkpoint (big failures)

---

## 16. Challenge 5: Human in the Loop

### Meaning

* Workflow pauses for **human decision**
* Examples:

  * JD approval
  * Offer approval

### LangChain

* Works only for short waits
* Not suitable for long approvals (hours or days)

### LangGraph

* First-class support
* Can pause indefinitely
* Resume after human input

---

## 17. Feature: Nested Workflows (Subgraphs)

### Concept

* A node can itself be a **graph**
* Enables:

  * Modular design
  * Reusability
  * Multi-agent systems

### Example

* “Conduct Interview” can be a full workflow:

  * Question generation
  * Multiple rounds
  * Evaluation

---

## 18. Observability (Monitoring & Debugging)

### Why Important

* Debug errors
* Audit decisions
* Understand agent behavior

### LangChain + LangSmith

* Tracks LangChain code
* ❌ Cannot track glue code

### LangGraph + LangSmith

* Full visibility
* Tracks:

  * Node execution
  * State changes
  * Human inputs
  * Decision paths

---

## 19. Final Summary

### What is LangGraph?

> LangGraph is an orchestration framework to build **stateful, multi-step, event-driven workflows** using LLMs.

Think of LangGraph as:

> **A flowchart engine for LLMs**

---

## 20. When to Use What?

### Use LangChain when:

* Simple linear flows
* Chatbots
* Summarizers
* Basic RAG

### Use LangGraph when:

* Complex workflows
* Conditions & loops
* Human-in-the-loop
* Event-driven execution
* Long-running systems
* Multi-agent systems

---

## 21. Important Note

* LangGraph does **not** replace LangChain
* LangGraph is built **on top of LangChain**
* You still use from LangChain:

  * Prompts
  * Models
  * Retrievers
  * Tools

👉 **LangChain = Components**
👉 **LangGraph = Orchestration**
